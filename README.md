This is my first Blockchain project written in Python which covers the basic elements of this innovative technology such as: cryptographic hash (digital signature of each transaction) generated by the SHA256 algorithm, transaction, sender, receiver and the timestamp of each transaction. 
The user is able to make a transaction using the command line (e.g. A sent 7 coins to B) which is then stored in a .json file as shown in the BlockChain.json.
