# Blockchain
This is my first Blockchain project written in Python which covers the basic elements of this innovative technology such as: cryptographic hash (digital signature of each transaction) generated by the SHA256 algorithm, the transaction introduced by the user, sender, receiver and the timestamp of each transaction. 
The user is able to complete a transaction using the command line (e.g. A sent 7 coins to B) which is then stored in a .json file as shown in BlockChain.json.
